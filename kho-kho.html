<h3>KHO-KHO GAME DETAILS<h3>
<h3>INTRO TO KHO-KHO</h3>
<p>Kho kho or kho-kho is a traditional Indian sport that dates back to ancient India.It is the second most popular traditional tag game in the Indian subcontinent after kabaddi.Kho kho is played on a rectangular court with a central lane connecting two poles which are at either end of the court. Each sitting player on the chasing team faces the opposite direction of their adjacent teammates.</p>
<p>At any time, one player on the chasing team (the 'active chaser'/'attacker') may run around the court to attempt to tag (touch) members of the defending team, with one point scored per tag, and each tagged defender required to leave the field; however, the active chaser cannot cross the central lane to access the other half of the field, and can not change direction once they start running toward either pole. Each team has two turns to score and two turns to defend, with each turn lasting nine minutes. The team that scores the most points by the end of the game wins.</p>
</p>The sport is widely played across South Asia, and also has a strong presence in the regions outside South Asia, such as South Africa and England. It is played most often by school children in India and Pakistan and is a competitive game. The first league of its kind called Ultimate Kho Kho was unveiled in India in August 2022.</p>


<h3>THE RULES ARE SIMPLE:<h3>
<p>Mark the playing area with the chalk or string. Draw a line down the middle of the field and place the poles at each end of the dividing line.
Divide yourselves into two equal teams (12 is ideal but not less than six). One team are the chasers and other, the defenders. Don’t worry, you’ll get to swap around often.
The chasing team lines up on the middle line, facing in alternate directions. 
You can only ‘chase’ on the side of the pitch you’re facing.
The defenders enter the field in groups of three. Defenders need to avoid being tagged by a chaser and can run anywhere on the field. If you get tagged, you’re out.
The chaser at the pole starts and must try to tag one of the defenders on their side of the field. If a defender crosses the line to the other side, the chaser taps one of his teammates who is sitting facing the other direction and shouts “Kho!”.
The teammate must then try to tag the defender.
Chasers can swap with a teammate every time the defender moves into the opposite side of the pitch.
Chasers, your aim is to tag all the defenders quickly.
The team that gets the defenders out the quickest, wins.</p>
