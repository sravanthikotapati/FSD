<center><h1>KABADDI</h1></center>
<h3>INTRO TO KABADDI</h3>
<p>Kabaddi is a contact team sport. Played between two teams of seven players, the objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many of their players and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders in 30 seconds. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or a tackle.</p>

<p>It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the national sport of Bangladesh.[2] It is the state game of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.

There are two major disciplines of kabaddi: "Punjabi kabaddi", also referred to as "circle styles", comprises traditional forms of the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors, while the "standard style", played on a rectangular court indoors, is the discipline played in major professional leagues and international competitions such as the Asian Games.</p>

<p>This game is known by numerous names in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, such as: kabaddi or chedugudu in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; kabaddi in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala; kabaddi, komonti or ha-du-du in West Bengal and Bangladesh; bhavatik in Maldives, kauddi or kabaddi in the Punjab region; hu-tu-tu in Western India, hu-do-do in Eastern India; chadakudu in South India; kapardi in Nepal; and kabadi or sadugudu in Tamil Nadu.</p>

<h3>Kabaddi World Cup</h3>
===============
<p>The Kabaddi World Cup is an outdoor international standard style kabaddi competition conducted by the International Kabaddi Federation (IKF), contested by men's and women's national teams. The competition has been previously contested in 2004, 2007 and 2016. All the tournaments have been won by India. India defeated Iran by 38–29 in the final of the championship game to clinch the title of 2016.

After the establishment of a new kabaddi organization named World Kabaddi Federation,[21] a 2019 Kabaddi World Cup was held in April 2019 at Malacca, Malaysia. It was the largest world cup in kabaddi history, consisting of 32 men’s teams and 24 women’s teams.</p>
<h4>court details</h4>
<p>In the international team version of kabaddi, two teams of seven members each occupy opposite halves of a court of 10 by 13 metres (33 ft × 43 ft) in case of men and 8 by 12 metres (26 ft × 39 ft) in case of women.
Use lines and markings to divide the court appropriately. The following are the official court markings as specified for professional Kabaddi; again, if you're playing casually with friends, your markings don't need to be exact.
Boundary lines: The lines at the edge of the 13 meter x 10 meter court.
Play area lines: These lines mark a 13 meter x 8 meter rectangular area inside the court — one meter of space separates each side from the 10 meter boundary lines above.
Mid line: This line divides the court into two 6.5 meters (21.3 ft) x 8 meter halves. Each team's "territory" is the play area on its side of the mid line.<br>
Baulk lines: These lines run parallel to the mid line and are 3.75 meters (12.3 ft) from it on either side.
Bonus lines: These lines run parallel to the baulk lines and are 1 meter (3.3 ft) from them on the side opposite the mid line.</p>

<p>When it comes to the most well-known and respected Kabaddi players in PKL, Rahul Chaudhari is probably the most well-known name. He has been a great player not only for the PKL teams but also for India’s National Kabaddi Team. He is the first PKL raider and player to earn more than 700 points. Surprisingly, he started out as a defender, but with persistence and hard work, he became a productive raider.</p>
<p>In a sum of 139 games, Rahul has scored 1040 strike focuses and with regards to safeguarding, he has 97 tackle focuses in a similar number of games. After a number of successful seasons with the Tamil Thalaivas and Telugu Titans, he now plays for Puneri Paltan.<br>

Sandeep Narwal does possess a certain aura and flair. That demonstrates how excellent a player he has been. Sandeep went from being a corner defender to being one of the best all-around players PKL has ever had. Sandeep’s “Boy Move” is well-known. Additionally, he was a member of the Indian contingent that won the gold medal at the 2016 South Asian Games. The man has a lot of muscle, which helps him get away from the guards.<br>
